# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions by Lakshay Gupta

Welcome to my curated collection of LeetCode solutions. This repository is designed not just to showcase problem-solving skills, but also to maintain clean, readable, and well-documented code using modern C++.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized by topic to make navigation easier:
```
leetcode-solutions/
│
├── Arrays/
├── BinarySearch/
├── LinkedList/
├── DynamicProgramming/
├── Graphs/
├── Trees/
└── TwoPointers/
```
Each folder contains `.cpp` files named using the format:
[problem-number]-[kebab-case-title].cpp

### Example:  
`0875-koko-eating-bananas.cpp`

---

## 📌 Code Format & File Header Style

Every solution file includes a detailed header comment block like the example below:

```cpp
/*
LeetCode #875: Koko Eating Bananas
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/
Difficulty: Medium
Tags: Array, Binary Search

Approach: Binary Search on the range of possible eating speeds [1, max(piles)].
For each candidate speed, compute the total hours Koko takes using ceiling division.
Narrow the search to find the minimum speed at which Koko can eat all bananas within h hours.

Time Complexity: O(n * log m), where n = number of piles, m = max pile size
Space Complexity: O(1)
*/
```

## Guidelines for New Solutions:
	•	Include the problem number, title, and link.
	•	Mention difficulty and relevant tags.
	•	Clearly describe your approach in plain English.
	•	State time and space complexities.

## 🧪 Local Testing

For local testing, you may optionally include a main() function within each .cpp file.
However, all solutions are designed to be submitted directly to LeetCode without modification.

### Example main stub:
```
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
    cout << sol.findMin(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
